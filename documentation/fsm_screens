# We need to draw the active screen, how do we switch between screens that are drawn?
		# Maybe, with the finite state shitsdoole, we have every screen pre planned out inside of an array
		# Say the array is called 'states', so when the program starts out, we are at the entry point,
		# The main menu, states[0], the in order to draw it we just need to call 'states[0].draw',
		# that '0' will be taken up by a 'state' variable. So as we interact with the program, main will
		# change the 'state' variable to the needed state, jumping around the array, calling the .draw()
		# Function constatly for the given interactive screen. So in the end, through main, we must create
		# ALl of the interactive screens, and hop around the array with the array through the states themself
		# the while loop will infinitely call states[state].draw, to display what is happening
		# Maybe, it could work something like this
		#
        # if mode == schedule (show schedule)
        # if mouse on event (show name and time)
        # if mode == add event (show ui)
